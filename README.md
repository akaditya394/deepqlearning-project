# Lunar Landing AI Project - Google Colab Notebook

## Overview
Welcome to the Lunar Landing AI project! This Google Colab notebook implements Deep Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, using the Gymnasium package to develop an artificial intelligence system capable of autonomously navigating and landing a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to training and testing the AI system.

## Features
- **Deep Q-Learning**: The notebook utilizes the Deep Q-Learning algorithm to train the AI system.
- **Gymnasium Environment**: The project integrates with Gymnasium, an open-source library for reinforcement learning environments, specifically using the lunar landing environment provided by Gymnasium.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Once trained, the AI is capable of autonomously navigating the spacecraft through the lunar environment, taking into account terrain features, altitude, and velocity.
- **Real-Time Decision Making**: During the descent phase of the lunar landing mission, the AI makes real-time decisions based on its learned policy to ensure a safe landing.
- **Adaptive Control**: The AI continuously adapts its control strategies based on feedback from the environment and rewards received during training.

## Usage
To use the Google Colab notebook:
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions provided in each cell to run the code sequentially.
3. Train the AI system using the provided training code blocks.
4. Test the trained AI system in the lunar landing environment using the provided testing code blocks.

## Configuration
The notebook includes code blocks for configuring the AI system and training parameters. Some configurable parameters include:
- **Training Parameters**: Set parameters such as learning rate, discount factor, exploration strategy, and training duration.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Configure the architecture of the neural network used by the Deep Q-Learning algorithm.
- **Environment Settings**: Adjust settings specific to the Gymnasium lunar landing environment, such as initial conditions and simulation duration.

Happy lunar landing! ðŸš€ðŸŒ•
